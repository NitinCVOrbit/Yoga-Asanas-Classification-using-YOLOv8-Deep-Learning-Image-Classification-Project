# 🧘‍♂️ Yoga Asanas Classification using YOLOv8

This repository contains an **end-to-end Deep Learning image classification project** that classifies different **Yoga Asanas** using **YOLOv8 Classification models** from the Ultralytics framework.

The project demonstrates the complete workflow from **dataset downloading** and **model training** to **inference and visualization of predictions with confidence scores**.
